You guys may know that it's about time for some new moderators, you might also know we have a lot of problems with abusive moderators. Here is a list of changes we have made to prevent this.

**Fixed Stuff:**

* Moderators can no longer kick members.
* We have a 1 - weak trial till they are accepted
* We have a better form (you can find it [here](https://forms.gle/vwWHfEyuMFM8sQka7))
* You most have sent 200+ messages
* 0 Warnings points

**Future Update:**

* You can only warn the same user every 5 minutes 
* That's all we have DM @Great Plains Modding if you have more ideas.

**Warn Points:**

**0 Points (either warn them 0 points or don’t warn at all)**

0 – Swearing

0 – Using a bot command in the wrong channel (verbal warning is enough)

0 – Hoisting, change nicknames if you see any hoisters.

0 – Invisible tagging users



**1 Point Warns (if feeling kind, you may warn 0 points to the user)**

1 – Using a bot command in the wrong channel after being asked to stop.

1 – Mentioning Moderators (or other bad roles) for no reason

1 – Mentioning random users for no reason (user\*\*s\*\* means multiple)

1 – Posting unrelated content in wrong channels like images in <#476507196033859593> 

1 – Typing in full caps a few times.

1 – Minor spam

1 – Abusing any bot command (including spamming the command)

1 – DMing a user when not agreed to

1 – Using any channel for the wrong reason several times

1 – Speaking a language that is not English when asked to stop



**2 Point Warns**

2 – Being consistently rude to another member

2 – Small advertising

2 – Constant swearing and rudeness, even when being asked to stop

2 – Attempting to start an unnecessary message chain



**3 Point Warns**

3 – Anything illegal

3 – Harassing a user over a period of time

3 – Impersonation (see last point of the list)

3 – Posting an invite by exploiting the bot

3 – Exploiting any weaknesses in the bot in general

3 – DM advertising

3 – Mass DMing users (3+)/spamming users DM’s.

3 – Racial or highly offensive slurs or terms that are directed towards a group or a specific user.



**4 Point Warns (could be 5 if need be)**
